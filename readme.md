This repository contains the data and codes for "Self-protection versus fear of stricter firearm regulations: examining the drivers of firearm acquisitions in the aftermath of a mass shooting".
The repository encompasses three files "Study 1.m", "Study 2.m", and "Study 3.m" for the respective studies in the paper. These scripts utilize the functions "guns_boot.m" for bootstrapping and "guns_ent2.m" to estimate the Shannon entropy.
In addition, the repository contains the datasets "BChecks.mat", "D.mat", "laws.mat", "MOfc.mat", "MOs.mat", "Mshooting_Patterns.mat", "Mshooting_Patterns_states.mat", and "population.mat" describing seasonally adjusted and detrended background checks by State, distance between centroid of States, law restrictive index for each State, media output on firearm control, media output on shootings, mass shooting occurence at a National level, mass shooting occurence at a State level, and population of each State, respectively.
